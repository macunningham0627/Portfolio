				Hello! My name is Marcelo Cunningham. I am a graduate from the

				This webpage serves to showcase my capability with
				the programming languages Java, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
				In fact, this page was built from scratch using HTML and CSS.
				What follows are descriptions of projects made using Java

				<p>
					Minesweeper is a game in which the player attempts
					to reveal squares in a grid while avoiding mines.

					<figcaption>This is what the grid looks like at the start of the game.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					A square is revealed by clicking on it; this will then
					show a number indicating how many adjacent squares
					contain a mine. Players must use this information to
					determine which squares are safe.
				</p>

					The player wins when every safe square has
					been revealed.

					The player loses if a square with a
					mine is clicked on.

						A mine was clicked on! The game board is cleared
						and the clicked mine is highlighted to show where
						the error occurred. The player is prompted to
						play again.

				</figure>
				<p>
					Flagging is an additional feature that allows the player
					to mark squares that they believe to contain mines.

					The locations of mines are randomized every time the game
					is played, creating	a new experience each time. 
					This project uses the Java programming language to build a
					fully functioning version of Minesweeper. Visit the link
					to try it out.

				<h1>Calculator</h1>
				<a href="../Calculator/index.html" target="_blank">Calculator project</a>
				<p>
					This project uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to
					create a calculator that can perform addition,
					subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents.
					The calculator can receive inputs by using the built
					in buttons or by pressing the corresponding keys on
					the keyboard. Visit the link to try it out.
